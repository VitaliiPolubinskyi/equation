Develop an application that will provide the following
possibilities:
1. Enter arithmetic expressions containing integers and fractions
numbers, as well as mathematical operators +, -, *, / and parentheses,
The nesting level of parentheses is arbitrary.
2. Check the entered expression for correct placement of brackets
3. Check the correctness of the entered expression (there should not be 2
signs of mathematical operations in a row, for example, is unacceptable
the expression 3+*4, at the same time, the expression 4*-7 is
acceptable)
If the expression is correct, evaluate its value and
save the expression and the calculated value in the database.
5. Provide the ability to view and edit expressions in
DB. If the expression remains correct after editing,
adjust its value in the database.
6. Implement functions for searching expressions in the database based on their results.
For example, a possible query: find all expressions whose values
equal (and also greater, less...) to the specified value.
7. The project must be implemented using a build system
Maven in one of the development environments: IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
